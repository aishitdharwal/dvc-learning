# Learning DVC (Data Version Control)

Welcome to the Learning DVC repository! This repository is designed to help you get started with Data Version Control (DVC), an open-source version control system for managing data science projects.

## What is DVC?

DVC is a tool that enhances the capabilities of Git, specifically tailored for managing large files commonly found in data science projects, such as datasets and model files. It allows data scientists to version control their data, track model versions, manage dependencies, and ensure reproducibility in their experiments.

## Getting Started

To begin learning DVC, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install DVC by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://dvc.org/doc/install).

2. **Initialization**: Initialize DVC in your project directory by running `dvc init`.

3. **Version Control Data**: Add your datasets or other large files to DVC using `dvc add`.

4. **Track Experiments**: Use DVC to track experiments, dependencies, and metrics by integrating it with tools like MLflow or TensorBoard.

5. **Collaborate**: Share your DVC project with collaborators by sharing the Git repository and providing access to the data files stored externally.
